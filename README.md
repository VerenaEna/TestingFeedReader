# Project Overview

In an existing project of a Feedreader was given to me!
I have to use Jasmine to test if the Javascript is working properly!

## Tests That Were Implemented
- * Tests for `allfeeds` has been defined and it is not empty
- * Tests for `allfeeds` have a url and it is not empty
- * Tests for `allfeeds` have a name and it is not empty
- * Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks the default menu is hidden
- * Toggles the menu if the menu appears or disappears
- * Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single `.entry` within the `.feed` container
- * Tests to see if two entries are different

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
