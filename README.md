## ProjectOverview

In this project Udacity provided me a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where me come in. I have to write the additional tests using Jasmine if the Javascript is working properly!

## Tests That Were Implemented
- * Test for `allfeeds` feeds has been defined and they are not empty
- * Test `allfeeds` have a url and it is not empty
- * Test `allfeeds` has a name and it is not empty
- * Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks the default menu is hidden
- * Toggles the menu if the menu appears or disappears
- * Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single `.entry` within the `.feed` container
- * Tests to see if two entries are different
